WARNING: 1.0.0.Alpha7 breaks incompatibility with previous versions in some cases. The major difference is that instead of using the _boot2docker_ keyword to refer to the auto resolved boot2docker ip in the _serverUri_ parameter, you should now used _dockerHost_.

== What is this?

*Arquillian Cube* is an _Arquillian_ extension that can be used to manager _Docker_ containers from _Arquillian_.

Extension is named *Cube* for two reasons:

* Because Docker is like a cube
* Because http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Borg_cube[Borg starship] is named *cube* and well because we are moving tests close to production we can say that "any resistance is futile, bugs will be assimilated".

With this extension you can start a _Docker_ container with a server installed, deploy the required deployable file within it and execute _Arquillian_ tests.

The key point here is that if _Docker_ is used as deployable platform in production, your tests are executed in a the same container as it will be in production, so your tests are even more real than before.

But it also lets you start a container with every required service like database, mail server, ... and instead of stubbing or using fake objects your tests can use real servers.

[WARNING]
====
This extension has been developed and tested on a Linux machine with the _Docker_ server already installed.
It works with *Boot2Docker* as well in _Windows_ and _MacOS_ machines, but some parameters like _host ip_ must be the _Boot2Docker_ server instead of _localhost_ (in case you have _Docker_ server installed inside your own machine).

One of the best resources to learn about why using _Boot2Docker_ is different from using _Docker_ in Linux can be read here http://viget.com/extend/how-to-use-docker-on-os-x-the-missing-guide
====

== Preliminaries

*Arquillian Cube* relies on https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java[docker-java] API.

To use *Arquillian Cube* you need a _Docker_ daemon running on a computer (it can be local or not), but probably it will be at local.

By default the _Docker_ server uses UNIX sockets for communicating with the _Docker_ client. *Arquillian Cube* will attempt to detect the operating system it is running on and either set _docker-java_ to use UNIX socket on _Linux_ or to <<Boot2Docker>> on _Windows_/_Mac_ as the default URI.

If you want to use TCP/IP to connect to the Docker server, you'll need to make sure that your _Docker_ server is listening on TCP port.
To allow _Docker_ server to use TCP add the following line to +/etc/default/docker+:

+DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"+

After restarting the _Docker_ daemon you need to make sure that _Docker_ is up and listening on TCP.

[source, terminal]
----
$ docker -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 version

Client version: 0.8.0
Go version (client): go1.2
Git commit (client): cc3a8c8
Server version: 1.2.0
Git commit (server): fa7b24f
Go version (server): go1.3.1
----

If you cannot see the client and server versions then it means that something is wrong with the _Docker_ installation.

== Basic Example

After having a _Docker_ server installed we can start using *Arquillian Cube*.
In this case we are going to use a very simple example using a _Docker_ image with _Apache Tomcat_ and we are going to test a _Servlet_ on it.

[source, java]
.HelloWorldServlet.java
----
@WebServlet("/HelloWorld")
public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {

  @Override
  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
    PrintWriter writer = resp.getWriter();
    writer.println("Hello World");
  }
}
----

[source, java]
.HelloWorldServletTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class HelloWorldServletTest {

  @Deployment(testable=false) //<1>
  public static WebArchive create() {
    return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class, "hello.war").addClass(HelloWorldServlet.class); //<2>
  }

  @Test
  public void should_parse_and_load_configuration_file(@ArquillianResource URL resource) throws IOException { //<3>

    URL obj = new URL(resource, "HelloWorld");
    HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) obj.openConnection();
    con.setRequestMethod("GET");

    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
            new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream()));
    String inputLine;
    StringBuffer response = new StringBuffer();

    while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
        response.append(inputLine);
    }
    in.close();

    assertThat(response.toString(), is("Hello World"));//<4>
  }
}
----
<1> In this case we are running the test as a client. So in fact this test is executed against the container instead of inside the container.
<2> No changes in this part, we need to create a deployable file, and because we are testing against _Tomcat_, a _war_ file is created.
<3> Because the test is run as client, we can use +@ArquillianResource+ to get the URL where the file is deployed. Note that this will be the URL to access _Tomcat_ running inside the _Docker_ container.
<4> Typical jUnit assertion of servlet response.

Now this test could be run in any container, there is nothing that ties this to _Docker_.
Next step is adding some dependencies apart from the typical _Arquillian_ dependencies.

----
<1> Adds *Arquillian Cube* dependency.
<2> From the point of view of _Arquillian_, _Tomcat_ is being executed in a remote host (in fact this is true because _Tomcat_ is running inside _Docker_ which is external to _Arquillian_), so we need to add the remote adapter.

And finally we need to configure _Tomcat_ remote adapter and *Arquillian Cube* in +arquillian.xml+ file.

----
<1> *Arquillian Cube* extension is registered.
<2> _Docker_ server version is required.
<3> _Docker_ server URI is required. In case you are using a remote _Docker_ host or _Boot2Docker_ here you need to set the remote host ip, but in this case _Docker_ server is on same machine.
<4> A _Docker_ container contains a lot of parameters that can be configured. To avoid having to create one XML property for each one, a YAML content can be embedded directly as property.
<5> Configuration of _Tomcat_ remote adapter. Cube will start the _Docker_ container when it is ran in the same context as an _Arquillian_ container with the same name.
<6> Host can be _localhost_ because there is a port forwarding between container and _Docker_ server.
<7> Port is exposed as well.
<8> User and password are required to deploy the war file to remote _Tomcat_.

And that's all.
Now you can run your test and you will see how _tutum/tomcat:7.0_ image is downloaded and started.
Ports 8080 (Tomcat standard port) and 8089(JMX port used by Arquillian) are exposed.
Finally in _env_ section, environment variables are set. Read next link to understand why this is required https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQ/Tomcat+7.0+-+Remote

== Configuration

*Arquillian Cube* requires some parameters to be configured, some related with _Docker_ server and others related on the image that is being used.
Let's see valid attributes:

[cols="2*"]
|===
|serverVersion
|Version of REST API provided by_Docker_ server. You should check on the _Docker_ site which version of REST API is shipped inside installed _Docker_ service. This field is not mandatory and if it's not set the default provided version from _docker-java_ will be used.

|serverUri
|Uri of _Docker_ server. If the _Docker_ server is running natively on Linux then this will be an URI pointing to _localhost_ docker host but if you are using _Boot2Docker_ or a remote _Docker_ server then the URI should be changed to point to the _Docker_ remote _URI_. It can be a unix socket URI as well in case you are running _Docker_ on Linux (+unix:///var/run/docker.sock+). Also you can read at <<automatic-resolution, this section>> about automatic resolution of serverUri parameter. Also you can use `DOCKER_HOST` java property or system environment to set this parameter.

|dockerRegistry
|Sets the location of Docker registry. Default value is the official _Docker_ registry located at https://registry.hub.docker.com

|dockerContainers
|Each _Docker_ image (or container) can be configured with different parameters. This configuration is provided in YAML format. This property can be used to embed as YAML string value, all configuration.

|dockerContainersFile
|Instead of embedding YAML as a string, you can set the location of a YAML file with this attribute. The location can be a relative from the root of the project or also a URI that is converted to URL so you can effectively have docker definitions on remote sites.

|definitionFormat
|Sets the format of content expressed in `dockerContainers` attribute or in file set in `dockerContainersFile`. It can contain two possible values _CUBE_ (default one in case of not set) to indicate that content is written following <<cube-format, Arquillian Cube>> format or _COMPOSE_ to indicate that content is written following <<docker-compose-format, Docker Compose>> format.

|autoStartContainers
|Cube will normally only start a _Docker_ container when it has the same name as an active _Arquillian_ container. That works for things that are _DeployableContainer_'s. For any other service, e.g. a database, you can use the _autoStartContainers_ option to define which _Docker_ containers to automatically start up. The option takes a comma separated list of _Docker_ container ids. e.g. _tomcat7, mysql_. *Arquillian Cube* will attempt to start the containers in parallel if possible as well as start any linked containers.

|certPath
|Path where certificates are stored. If you are not using _https_ protocol this parameter is not required. This parameter accepts starting with ~ as home directory

|boot2dockerPath
|Sets the full location (and program name) of _boot2docker_. For example +/opt/boot2dockerhome/boot2docker+.

|dockerMachinePath
|Sets the full location (and program name) of _docker-machine_. For example +/opt/dockermachinehome/docker-machine+.

|machineName
|Sets the machine name in case you are using docker-machine to manage your docker host. This parameter is mandatory when using docker-machine.

|connectionMode
|Connection Mode to bypass the Create/Start Cube commands if the a Docker Container with the same name is already running on the target system. This parameter can receive three possible values. _STARTANDSTOP_ which is the default one if not set any and simply creates and stops all Docker Containers. If a container is already running, an exception is thrown. _STARTORCONNECT_ mode tries to bypass the Create/Start Cube commands if a container with the same name is already running, and if it is the case doesn’t stop it at the end. But if container is not already running, Cube will start one and stop it at the end of the execution. And last mode is _STARTORCONNECTANDLEAVE_ which is exactly the same of _STARTORCONNECT_ but if container is started by Cube it won’t be stopped at the end of the execution so it can be reused in next executions.
|===

Some of these properties can be provided by using standard Docker system environment variables so you can set once and use them in your tests too.
Moreover you can set as Java system properties (-D...) as well.

[cols="2*"]
|===
|serverUri
|DOCKER_HOST

|certPath
|DOCKER_CERT_PATH

|machineName
|DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME
|===

In the next example you can see a whole YAML document with configuration properties.
Keep in mind that almost all of them are configuration parameters provided by _Docker_ remote API.
In this example we are going to explain the attributes that are most used and special cases.
Of course not all of them are mandatory:

NOTE: In YAML adding brackets ("[" "]") is for setting a list.

----
<1> The name that are going to be assign to running container. It is *mandatory*.
<2> The name of the image to be used. It is *mandatory*. If the image has not already been pulled by the _Docker_ server, *Arquillian Cube* will pull it for you. If you want to always pull latest image before container is created, you can configure *alwaysPull: true*.
<3> Sets exposed ports of the running container. It should follow the format _port number_ slash(/) and _protocol (udp or tcp). Note that it is a list and it is not mandatory.
<4> After a container is started, it starts booting up the defined services/commands. Depending on the nature of service, the lifecycle of these services are linked to start up or not. For example Tomcat, Wildlfy, TomEE and in general all Java servers must be started in foreground and this means that from the point of view of the client, the container never finishes to start. But on the other side other services like Redis are started in background and when the container is started you can be sure that Redis server is there. To avoid executing tests before the services are ready, you can set which await strategy should be used from *Arquillian Cube* side to accept that _Docker_ container and all its defined services are up and ready. It is not mandatory and by default polling with _ss_ command strategy is used.
<5> In +strategy+ you set which strategy you want to follow. Currently three strategies are supported. _static_, _native_ and _polling_.
<6> You can pass environment variables by using `env`. In this section you can set special `dockerServerIp` string which at runtime will be replaced by _Cube_ to current docker server ip.
<7> After the container is up, a list of commands can be executed within it.
<8> Port forwarding is configured using `portBinding` section. It contains a list of `exposedPort` and `port` separated by arrow (_->_). If only one port is provided, *Arquillian Cube* will expose the same port number. In this example the exposed port 8089 is mapped to 8089 and exposed port 8080 is mapped to 8081.
<9> You can extend another configuration. Any top level element and it's children from the target container-id will be copied over to this configuration, unless they have been defined here already.

As we've seen in the basic example the definition of the Arquillian Cube scenarios are described in `dockerContainers` property.
But if you want you can avoid using this property by simply creating a file called `cube` in the root of the classpath of your project.
_Arquillian Cube_ will read it as if it was defined in `arquilllian.xml` file.

=== Await

After a container is started, it starts booting up the defined services/commands.
Depending on the nature of service, the lifecycle of these services are linked to start up or not.
For example Tomcat, Wildlfy, TomEE and in general all Java servers must be started in foreground and this means that from the point of view of the _Docker_ client, the container never finishes to start.
But on the other side other services like Redis are started in background and when the container is started you can be sure that Redis server is there.
To avoid executing tests before the services are ready, you can set which await strategy should be used from *Arquillian Cube* side to accept that _Docker_ container and all its defined services are up and ready.

Currently next await strategies are supported:

native:: it uses *wait* command. In this case current thread is waiting until the _Docker_ server notifies that has started. In case of foreground services this is not the approach to be used.
polling:: in this case a polling (with _ping_ or _ss_ command) is executed for 5 seconds against all exposed ports. When communication to all exposed ports is acknowledged, the container is considered to be up. This approach is the one to be used in case of services started in foreground. By default _polling_ executes _ss_ command inside the running container to know if the server is already running. You can use a _ping_ from client by setting +type+ attribute to +ping+; Note that _ping_ only works if you are running _Docker_ daemon on +localhost+. In almost all cases the default behaviour matches all scenarios. If it is not specified, this is the default strategy.
static:: similar to _polling_ but it uses the host ip and specified list of ports provided as configuration parameter. This can be used in case of using _Boot2Docker_.
sleeping:: sleeps current thread for the specified amount of time. You can specify the time in seconds or milliseconds.

By default in case you don't specify any _await_ strategy, polling with _ss_ command is used.

=== Inferring exposedPorts from portBinding

When you are using _Docker_ you can set two different parameters, +exposedPort+ and +portBinding+.
+exposedPorts+ are ports that are available inside _Docker_ infrastructure and they are used for communication between _Docker_ containers but not from outside.
On the other side +portBindings+ are a way to instruct _Docker_ container to publish a port to be available from outside (for example from our test).

It seems reasonable that if you set a port binding this port should automatically be exposed port as well.
For this reason in *Arquillian Cube* you can use +portBinding+ and it will automatically set to exposed port.

In next example we are only setting +portBinding+ and *Arquillian Cube* will instruct _Docker_ to expose port 8080 and of course bind the port 8080 so it can be accessible from outside.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
daytime:
  buildImage:
    dockerfileLocation: src/test/resources/undertow
    noCache: true
    remove: true
  await:
    strategy: polling
  portBindings: [8080/tcp]
----

Also it is not necessary to set the network protocol (tcp or udp).
If protocol is not specified `portBindings: ["8080"]` then _tcp_ is used by default.
Notice that you need to add double-quotes to stringify the value.

=== Allow connecting to a running container

With the configuration option +connectionMode+ you can bypass
the Create/Start Cube commands if the a _Docker_ Container with the same name is already
running on the target system. If so, *Arquillian Cube* will reuse that Container moving forward.

This allows you to prestart the containers manually during development and just
connect to them to avoid the extra cost of starting the _Docker_ Containers for each test
run. This assumes you are not changing the actual definition of the _Docker_ Container itself.

An example of this configuration could be:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="docker">
  <property name="serverVersion">1.12</property>
  <property name="serverUri">http://localhost:2375</property>
  <property name="connectionMode">STARTORCONNECT</property>
  <property name="dockerContainers">
      tomcat:
        #more properties
  </property>
</extension>
----

+connectionMode+ is an attribute that can receive three parameters:

STARTANDSTOP:: it is the default one if not set any and simply creates and stops all _Docker_ Containers. If a container is already running, an exception is thrown.
STARTORCONNECT:: it tries to bypass the Create/Start Cube commands if a container with the same name is already running, and if it is the case doesn’t stop it at the end. But if container is not already running, Cube will start one and stop it at the end of the execution.
STARTORCONNECTANDLEAVE:: it is exactly the same of _STARTORCONNECT_ but if container is started by Cube it won’t be stopped at the end of the execution so it can be reused in next executions.

=== Before Stop Events

Sometimes when the tests has finished and container is stopped you want to inspect some data like container console or getting a file from the container to manual inspecting.
In these cases you can configure each container to copy console log or copy a file/s from container to local machine just before container is stopped.

Next snippet shows how to copy a directory from container to local disk:

[source, yaml]
----
tomcat_default:
  image: tutum/tomcat:7.0
  beforeStop: # <1>
    - copy: # <2>
        from: /test
        to: /tmp

    - log: # <3>
        to: /tmp/container.log
----
<1> +beforeStop+ goes into the container section and may contain a list of +copy+ and +log+ elements.
<2> +copy+ is used to notify that we want to copy some directories or files form +from+ container location to +to+ local location.
<3> +log+ is used to notify that we want to copy container log to +to+ local location.

In case of +log+ command the standard output and the error output are returned.
+log+ _Docker_ command can receive some configuration paramters and you can set them too in configuration file.

[source, yaml]
.Example of log parameters
----
beforeStop:
  - log:
    to: /tmp/container.log
    follow: true
    stdout: true
    stderr: false
    timestamps: true
    tail: 10
----

[[automatic-resolution]]
=== Automatic serverUri resolution

+serverUri+ parameter is where you configure the Uri of _Docker_ server.
This parameter is not mandatory and in case you don't set it, _Arquillian Cube_ will use next values:

[cols="2*"]
|===
|Linux
|unix:///var/run/docker.sock

|Windows
|https://dockerHost:2376

|MacOS
|https://dockerHost:2376

|Docker Machine

|===

[[boot2docker]]
== Boot2Docker and Docker Machine

If you are using _boot2docker_ or _docker machine_ there are some parameters that depends on the local installation.
For example _boot2docker_ ip is not _localhost_ and may change every time you start a new _boot2docker_ instance.
Also every time you start _boot2docker_ copies required certificates to home directory of local machine.

_Arquillian Cube_ offers some automatic mechanisms to use _boot2docker_ or _docker machine_ in _Cube_.

The first one is that +serverUri+ parameter can contain the word +dockerHost+ like for example +https://dockerHost:2376+.
When _Cube_ is started it will check if the +serverUri+ contains the _dockerHost_ word, and if it is the case it will do next things:

. if docker machine name is provided by using +machineName+ property then Docker Machine command is run to get the ip to be replaced in `dockerHost`.
. if previous conditions are not met, then _boot2docker_ command is run to get the ip to be replaced in `dockerHost`.

=== Boot2Docker

In case of _boot2docker_ it will run the command +boot2docker ip+ to get the ip and substitute the _dockerHost_ keyword to the ip returned by that command.

Note that by default _Arquillian Cube_ assumes that +boot2docker+ command is on +PATH+, but you can configure its location by using +boot2dockerPath+ property which is the full location (and program name) of _boot2docker_.
For example +/opt/boot2dockerhome/boot2docker+.

_boot2docker_ runs in _https_ and you need to set the certificates path.
These certificates are copied by _boot2docker_ by default at +<HOME>/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm+.
If this property is not set and the +serverUri+ contains +dockerHost+, then this property is automatically configured to +<HOME>/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm+ so you don't need to worry to set for each environment.

=== Docker Machine

In case of _docker-machine_ it will run the command +docker-machine ip <machineName>+ to get the ip and substitute the _dockerHost_ keyword to the ip returned by that command.

Note that by default _Arquillian Cube_ assumes that +docker-machine+ command is on +PATH+, but you can configure its location by using the +dockerMachinePath+ proeprty which is the full location (and program name too) of _docker-machine_.
For example +/usr/bin/docker-machine+..

_docker-machine_ can run with _boot2docker_ together.
And this docker host instance runs in _https_ so you need to set the certificates path.
These certificates are copied by _docker-machine_ by default at +<HOME>/.docker/machine/machines+.
If this property is not set and _docker-machine_ is run, then this property is automatically configured to default location, so you don't need to worry to set for each environment.

For example you can configure +arquillian.xml+ file to use _docker-machine_ as:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="docker">
    <property name="serverVersion">${docker.api.version}</property>
    <property name="definitionFormat">COMPOSE</property>
    <property name="machineName">dev</property> <!-- 1 -->
    <property name="dockerContainersFile">docker-compose.yml</property>
</extension>
----
<1> Sets docker machine to _dev_.

Notice that you only need to add _machineName_ property, everything else it is exactly the same as previous examples.

== Building containers

To build a container _Docker_ uses a file called +Dockerfile+ http://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/.
*Arquillian Cube* also supports building and running a container from a +Dockerfile+.

To set that *Arquillian Cube* must build the container, the +image+ property must be changed to +buildImage+ and add the location of +Dockerfile+.

Let's see previous example but instead of creating a container from a predefined image, we are going to build one:

[source, yaml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<property name="dockerContainers">
  tomcat:
    buildImage: #1
      dockerfileLocation: src/test/resources-tomcat-7-dockerfile/tomcat #2
      noCache: true #3
      remove: true #4
      dockerfileName: my-dockerfile #5
    await:
      strategy: polling
    env: [JAVA_OPTS=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8089 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false]
    portBindings: [8089/tcp, 8080/tcp]
</property>
----
<1> +buildImage+ section is used in front of +image+. In case of both sections present in a document, +image+ section has preference over +buildImage+.
<2> +dockerfileLocation+ contains the location of +Dockerfile+ and all files required to build the container.
<3> Property to enable or disable the no cache attribute.
<4> Property to enable or disable the remove attribute.
<5> Property to set the dockerfile name to be used instead of the default ones.

TIP: +dockerfileLocation+ can be a directory that must contains +Dockerfile+ in root directory (in case you don't set _dockerfileName_ property), also a +tar.gz+ file or a _URL_ pointing to a +tar.gz+ file.

An example of +Dockerfile+ is:

[source, properties]
.src/test/resources-tomcat-7-dockerfile/tomcat/Dockerfile
----
FROM tutum/tomcat:7.0

ENV JAVA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8089 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
ADD tomcat-users.xml /tomcat/conf/ # <1>
EXPOSE 8089
CMD ["/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh","run"]
----
<1> +tomcat-users.xml+ file is located at same directory as +Dockerfile+.

[[docker-compose-format]]
== Docker-Compose Format

Instead of using Arquillian Cube format, you can use Docker Compose format to define containers layout. This means that you can use the same Docker Compose file for running your tests with Arquillian Cube and without any change run `docker-compose up` command from terminal and get the same result.

It is important to note that this is not a docker-compose implementation but only the docker-compose format. This means that for example you cannot execute some CLI commands of _docker-compose_ like start several instances of same service.

In case of some specific Arquillian Cube attributes like await strategy cannot be configured and the default values are going to be used.

Moreover there are some docker-compose commands that are not implemented yet due to restrictions on docker-java library. These commands are  _pid_, _log_driver_ and _security_opt_. But they will be implemented as soon as docker-java library adds their support.

Last thing, in case you define a command that is not implemented in Arquillian Cube, this command will be ignored (no exception will be thrown), but a log line will be printed notifying this situation. Please it is really important that if this happens you open a bug so we can add support for them. Althought this warning we will try to maintain aligned with the latest docker-compose format.

Let's see how you can rewrite previous HelloWorld example with Tomcat to be used using docker-compose format.

First let's create a file called `envs` on root of the project which configures environment variables:

[source]
.envs
----
TOMCAT_PASS=mypass
JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=8088 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8089 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
----

Then you can create a file called `docker-compose.yml` following docker-compose commands on root of the project:

[source, yml]
.docker-compose.yml
----
tomcat:
  env_file: envs
  image: tutum/tomcat:7.0
  ports:
      - "8089:8089"
      - "8088:8088"
      - "8081:8080"
----

and finally you can configure in `arquillian.xml` file that you want to use docker-compose format.

[source, xml]
.src/test/resources/arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="docker">
  <property name="serverVersion">1.13</property>
  <property name="serverUri">localhost</property>
  <property name="definitionFormat">COMPOSE</property>
  <property name="dockerContainersFile">docker-compose.yml</property>
</extension>

<container qualifier="tomcat">
  <configuration>
    <property name="host">${docker.tomcat.host}</property>
    <property name="httpPort">8081</property>
    <property name="user">admin</property>
    <property name="pass">mypass</property>
  </configuration>
</container>
----

And that's all, you can now reuse your existing docker-compose files in Arquillian Cube too.
You can see the full example at: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube/tree/master/docker/ftest-docker-compose

== Enrichers

*Arquillian Cube* comes with a few enrichers.

One for injecting the +CubeID+(_containerId_) of the current container created for executing the test, one that injects the +CubeController+ to call lifecycle methods on any cube and one that injects +com.github.dockerjava.api.DockerClient+ instance used to communicate with _Docker_ server.

DockerClient injection only work if the tests are run in client mode, that is by using +@RunAsClient+ or by setting the testable property to false +@Deployment(testable = false)+.

These can be injected using the +@ArquillianResource+ annotation.

As examples:

[source, java]
.CubeIDResourceProvider.java
----
@ArquillianResource
CubeID containerId;
----

[source, java]
.CubeResourceProvider.java
----
@ArquillianResource
DockerClient dockerClient;
----

[source, java]
.CubeControllerProvider.java
----
@ArquillianResource
CubeController cubeController;
----

=== Auto starting Cubes outside of Arquillian Containers

Probably any application you may write will need an application/servlet container but also other servers like database server or mail server.
Each one will be placed on one _Docker Container_.
So for example a full application may contain one _Docker Container_ with an application server (for example _Wildfly_) and another container with a database (for example _H2_).

*Arquillian Cube* can orchestrate these containers as well.

An example of orchestration can be:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<property name="autoStartContainers">database</property> <!--1-->
<property name="dockerContainers">
  wildfly_database:
    extends: wildfly
    links:
      - database:database #2
  database:
    image: zhilvis/h2-db
    exposedPorts: [81/tcp, 1521/tcp]
    await:
      strategy: polling
    portBindings: [1521/tcp, 8181->81/tcp]
  </property>

<container qualifier="wildfly_database">
  <configuration>
    <property name="target">wildfly:8.1.0.Final:remote</property>
    <property name="managementPort">9991</property>
    <property name="username">admin</property>
    <property name="password">Admin#70365</property>
  </configuration>
</container>
----
<1> This property is used to start containers before any test is executed. In this case _database_ container.
<2> We use _link_ property to connect _Wildfly_ container to _database_ container.

In this case when a test is started both containers are started and when both are ready to receive requests, the test will be executed.

And the database definition shall be:

[source, java]
.UserRepository.java
----
@DataSourceDefinition(
  name = "java:app/TestDataSource",
  className = "org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource",
  url = "jdbc:h2:tcp://database:1521/opt/h2-data/test",
  user = "sa",
  password = "sa"
)
@Stateless
public class UserRepository {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

    public void store(User user) {
        em.persist(user);
    }
}
----

=== Auto-Remapping

*Arquillian Cube* can automatically configure default ports of container in case of port forwarding.

What *Arquillian Cube* does internally is remapping default `DeployableContainer` port values to the ones configured in _Docker Containers_ configuration.

Suppose you have a _Docker Container_ configuration like:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<property name="dockerContainers">
    tomcat_default:
      image: tutum/tomcat:7.0
      exposedPorts: [8089/tcp]
      await:
        strategy: polling
      env: [TOMCAT_PASS=mypass, JAVA_OPTS=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8089 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false]
      portBindings: [8089/tcp, 8081->8080/tcp] #1
</property>
----
<1> Note that the exposed port is the 8081.

Then in theory you should configure the remote _Tomcat_ adapter to port 8081 on your _arquillian.xml_ file.
But let's say that you are using that remote adapter for a remote local machine _Tomcat_ (outside _Docker_) too, and is configured to use 8080 port.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<container qualifier="tomcat_default">
  configuration>
    <property name="host">localhost</property>
    <property name="user">admin</property>
    <property name="pass">mypass</property>
  </configuration>
</container>
----

Which basically uses default port (8080) to connect to remote server.

In this case you don't need to create a new `container` tag, *Arquillian Cube* is smart enough to change the default port value automatically; in case of _Tomcat_ 8080 to 8081.
*Arquillan Cube* will apply autoremapping to all properties that contains `port` as a substring of the property, and will remap if it is necessary.

NOTE: Automapping only works in case you want to change the default server port to a _Docker_ port forwarded port.

=== DockerServerIp and Containers

If you are using a remote docker server (not on _localhost_) or for example _boot2docker_ you may want to set that ip to Arquillian remote adapter configuration so it can deploy the archive under test.
In these cases you can hardcode this ip to Arquillian container adapter configuration or you can use the special tag +dockerServerIp+.
At runtime these tag will be replaced by _Arquillian Cube_ to docker server ip configured in +serverUri+ parameter.
This replacement only works in properties that contains the string +host+ or +address+ in property name.

So for example:

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<extension qualifier="docker">
        <property name="serverUri">http://192.168.0.2:2756</property> <!--1-->
  ...
</extension>
<container qualifier="tomcat_default">
  configuration>
    <property name="host">dockerServerIp</property> <!--2-->
    <property name="user">admin</property>
    <property name="pass">mypass</property>
  </configuration>
</container>
----
<1> We set the +serverUri+ as usually.
<2> +dockerServerIp+ is replaced at runtime.

The +host+ property will be replaced automatically to +192.168.0.2+.

NOTE: This also works in case you set +serverUri+ using +boot2docker+ special word or by using the defaults. Read more about it <<boot2docker, Boot2Docker section>> and <<automatic-resolution, Automatic serverUri resolution section>>.

In case of using _unix_ socket +dockerServerUri+ is replaced to _localhost_.

Also _Arquillian Cube_ can help you in another way inferring +boot2docker+ ip.
In case you are running in _MACOS_ or _Windows_ with +boot2docker+, you may not need to set host property at all nor using +dockerServerIp+.
_Arquillian Cube_ will inspect any property in configuration class that contains the word _address_ or _host_ that it is not overriden in `arquillian.xml` and it will set the +boot2docker+ server automatically.

So previous example could be modified to:

[source.xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<container qualifier="tomcat_default">
  configuration>
    <property name="user">admin</property>
    <property name="pass">mypass</property>
  </configuration>
</container>
----

And in case you are running on _Windows_ or _MacOS_, `host`property will be automatically set to the +boot2docker +_ip_.

== Containerless Server and Docker

In all previous sections we have seen that the application is deployed inside a container.
For example in case of _Tomcat_ application, resources are deployed inside a _Servlet_ container or for example in case of _Apache TomEE_ you can deploy _EJBs_ inside an _EJB_ container.

But nowadays there other kind of applications that contains the container (if they have one) embedded inside them.
Typically these applications uses an embedded server and they are run as _CLI_ applications.
Some examples can be _Spring Boot_, _Netty_, _SparkJava_ or _Undertow_.

If you are using some of these technologies with _Docker_, you can still use *Arquillian Cube* to write your tests.

=== Java Embedded Servers

Let's suppose we are writing a service which should return as text the current day and time.
To serve this service to the world we decide to use _undertow_ embedded server.

The code looks like:

[source, java]
.DaytimeServer.java
----
import io.undertow.Undertow;
import io.undertow.server.HttpHandler;
import io.undertow.server.HttpServerExchange;
import io.undertow.util.Headers;

import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

public class DaytimeServer {

  public static void main(String[] args) { //<1>

      Undertow server = Undertow.builder()
              .addHttpListener(8080, "0.0.0.0")
              .setHandler(new HttpHandler() {
                @Override
                public void handleRequest(final HttpServerExchange exchange) throws Exception {
                    SimpleDateFormat simpleDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat();
                    exchange.getResponseHeaders().put(Headers.CONTENT_TYPE, "text/plain");
                    exchange.getResponseSender().send(simpleDateFormat.format(new Date()) + System.lineSeparator()); //<2>
                }
            }).build();
       server.start();
  }
}
----
<1> This class is a CLI application.
<2> Returns a text with the day and time formatted with +SimpleDateFormat+.

See that this application is a CLI application which is pretty different from previous examples.
Previously the packaged application was deployed inside an application server, which in fact means that *Arquillian* connects to the server and tells it to deploy that file.

In this example there is no application server nor servlet server waiting for *Arquillian* to deploy an archive but the application is self-contained, it contains everything.
So in fact if you want to run the application probably you will end up by doing something like +java -jar daytime.jar+.

So how to write a test for these classes if we are using _Docker_ as runtime container?

The first thing to do is add +arquillian-cube-containerless+ dependency.

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.arquillian.cube</groupId>
  <artifactId>arquillian-cube-containerless</artifactId>
  <version>${arquillian.cube.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Next step is creating a +Dockerfile+.
This is required because we need to set not only the container image to be used but how to run the application.
But see that there is a problem on creating a +Dockerfile+ in this case.
The +jar+ name is not static because it will depend on the name you give during the creation of the archive (using _Shrinkwrap_).
So in fact +Dockerfile+ should be templaterized.
And this is something that *Arquillian Cube* can do for you.
The idea is creating a file called +DockerfileTemplate+.

[source, terminal]
.src/test/resources/daytime/DockerfileTemplate
----
FROM java:7

WORKDIR /usr/src/server
COPY ${deployableFilename} /usr/src/server/${deployableFilename} #1
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["java", "-jar", "${deployableFilename}"]
----
<1> +${deployableFilname}+ will be replaced at runtime by the name of the +jar+ file created by _Shrinkwrap_.

Then we need to touch +arquillian.xml+ file by setting an special container definition so *Arquillian* doesn't crash because of trying to deploy the archive into a none defined container.

[source, xml]
.src/test/resources/arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
  http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

  <extension qualifier="docker">
    <property name="serverVersion">1.12</property>
    <property name="serverUri">http://localhost:2375</property>
    <property name="dockerContainers"> <!--1-->
      daytime:
        buildImage: <!--2-->
          dockerfileLocation: src/test/resources/undertow <!--3-->
          noCache: true
          remove: true
        await:
          strategy: polling
        portBindings: [8080/tcp]
    </property>
  </extension>

  <container qualifier="containerless" default="true"> <!--4-->
    <configuration>
        <property name="containerlessDocker">daytime</property> <!--5-->
        <property name="embeddedPort">8080</property> <!--6-->
    </configuration>
  </container>

</arquillian>
----
<1> The Docker container is defined as per usual.
<2> buildImage attribute is used to define the dockerfile location.
<3> This attribute sets the directory where the +Dockerfile+ is stored. In fact in this case it is the directory where +DockerfileTemplate+ file is stored.
<4> A container provided by *Arquillian Cube* must be defined.
<5> This property is used to set which container must be started.
<6> This property sets the exposed port by the embedded server.

And finally the test:

[source, java]
.DaytimeTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class DaytimeTest {

  private static final String LINE_SEPARATOR = System
          .getProperty("line.separator");

  @Deployment(testable = false) //<1>
  public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
      JavaArchive[] undertow = Maven.resolver().resolve("io.undertow:undertow-core:1.1.1.Final").withTransitivity().as(JavaArchive.class); //<2>

      JavaArchive jar = ShrinkWrap
              .create(JavaArchive.class, "daytime.jar")
              .addClass(DaytimeServer.class); //<3>

      for (JavaArchive javaArchive : undertow) { //<4>
          jar.merge(javaArchive);
      }

      jar.addAsManifestResource(
              new StringAsset(
                      "Main-Class: org.arquillian.cube.impl.containerless.DaytimeServer"
                              + LINE_SEPARATOR), "MANIFEST.MF"); //<5>
      return jar;
  }

  @Test
  public void shouldReturnDateFromDaytimeServer(@ArquillianResource URL base) { //<6>
      try (
              BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(
                    base.openStream()));) {
          String userInput = in.readLine();
          assertThat(userInput, notNullValue());
      } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
          fail("Don't know about host ");
      } catch (IOException e) {
          fail("Couldn't get I/O for the connection to ");
      }
  }
}
----
<1> Tests should be run as-client.
<2> _ShrinkWrap_ Maven resolver gets all dependencies for _Undertow_.
<3> Create a +jar+ file called +daytime.jar+ with +DaytimeServer+ class.
<4> +Undertow+ dependencies are merged inside +jar+.
<5> Because it is a runnable +jar+, +MANIFEST+ is created accordantly.
<6> Simple test.

=== Polyglot Applications

In previous section we have seen that we can test any _java_ _CLI_ application that offers a socket connection.
But if you think clearly there is nothing that avoid *Arquillian Cube* to deploy applications developed in other languages like _Node.js_, _Play_, _Ruby on Rails_, ...

Let's see an example on how you can use *Arquillian Cube* to test a _Node.js_ _hello world_ application.

First thing to do is create the _Node.js_ application.

[source, json]
.src/main/js/package.json
----
{
  "name": "helloworld-server",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A NodeJS webserver to run inside a docker container",
  "author": "asotobu@gmail.com",
  "license": "APLv2",
  "dependencies": {
      "express": "*"
  },
  "scripts": {"start": "node index.js"}
}
----

[source, javascript]
.src/main/js/index.js
----
var express = require('express');

var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.send('Hello from inside a container!');
});

app.listen(8080);
----

Then we need to define a +DockerfileTemplate+ as we did for +Undertow+.

[source]
.src/test/resources/node/DockerfileTemplate
----
FROM node:0.11.14

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

ADD ${deployableFilename} /usr/src/app #1
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
----
<1> We need to use +ADD+ command adding the deployed file instead of +COPY+. We are going to see why below.

Finally the +arquillian.xml+ configuration file.

[source, xml]
.arquillian.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<arquillian xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
  http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

  <extension qualifier="docker">
    <property name="serverVersion">1.12</property>
    <property name="serverUri">http://localhost:2375</property>
    <property name="dockerContainers">
        node:
          buildImage:
            dockerfileLocation: src/test/resources/node
            noCache: true
            remove: true
          await:
            strategy: polling
          portBindings: [8080/tcp]
    </property>
  </extension>

  <container qualifier="containerless" default="true">
    <configuration>
      <property name="containerlessDocker">node</property> <!--1-->
      <property name="embeddedPort">8080</property>
    </configuration>
  </container>

</arquillian>
----
<1> This property is used to set which container must be started. In this case +node+.

And finally the *Arquillian* test.

[source, java]
.NodeTest.java
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class NodeTest {

  @Deployment(testable = false) //<1>
  public static GenericArchive createDeployment() {
    return ShrinkWrap.create(GenericArchive.class, "app.tar") //<2>
            .add(new ClassLoaderAsset("index.js"), "index.js")
            .add(new ClassLoaderAsset("package.json"), "package.json");
  }

  @Test
  public void shouldReturnMessageFromNodeJs(@ArquillianResource URL base) { //<3>
    try (BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(
            base.openStream()));) {
        String userInput = in.readLine();
        assertThat(userInput, is("Hello from inside a container!"));
    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
        fail("Don't know about host ");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        fail("Couldn't get I/O for the connection to ");
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Tests should be run as-client.
<2> +GenericArchive+ with +tar+ extension must be created using _Shrinkwrap_.
<3> Simple test.

NOTE: +GenericArchive+ must end with +tar+ extension because it is expected by *Arquillian Cube*. When you use +ADD+ in +Dockerfile+, _Docker_ will untar automatically the file to given location.

== Future work

API will continuously evolve to fit requirements of an enterprise application as well as providing integration with _Kubernates_ and other Docker related tools.
Also some configuration parameters will be modified to fix any possible requirements.
Although we are going to try to not break compatibility with previous versions, we cannot guarantee until _beta_ stage.

Feel free to use it and any missing feature, bug or anything you see , feel free to add a new issue.
