WARNING: 1.0.0.Alpha7 breaks incompatibility with previous versions in some cases. The major difference is that instead of using the _boot2docker_ keyword to refer to the auto resolved boot2docker ip in the _serverUri_ parameter, you should now used _dockerHost_.

IMPORTANT: 1.0.0.Alpha13 changes default format from Cube to Docker Compose. In case you are using Cube format you need to update arquillian.xml with `<property name="definitionFormat">CUBE</property>`

== Future work

Some configuration parameters will be modified to fix any possible requirements.
Although we are going to try to not break compatibility with previous versions, we cannot guarantee until _beta_ stage.

Feel free to use it and any missing feature, bug or anything you see , feel free to add a new issue.
