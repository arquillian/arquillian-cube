= Getting started with Arquillian Cube

Complete documentation for Arquillian Cube is available at http://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/.

The https://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/#_preliminaries[Preliminaries] section will guide you through the
required steps to set up your local configuration, at least for Docker container usage.

In order to get started, see the https://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/#_basic_example[Basic example] and the
https://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/#_standalone_example[Standalone example] sections.

https://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/#_kubernetes[Kubernetes documentation] is available too, and you can find out
more in the https://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/#_arquillian_kubernetes_and_openshift_recipes[Arquillian Kubernetes
and OpenShift Recipes] section.

Finally, don't forget to check the integration tests in each submodule, as they might be a good starting point for
your own use cases.
